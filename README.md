# PintoGPi
## This project is just a Gentoo intalation in Pi model 1 B+ with a [Zx Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) emulator
- Why Gentoo, just because I can and I whant to test some cross compiling "techniques" ;)
- The instalations will be made all from  my Arch Linux [PintArch](https://github.com/dpnpinto/PintArch)
- Don't use my instlations, install [Arch](https://archlinux.org) from scratch and, then, you are prepared for [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org)

### Steps to get it done

- Partition the SD card the right way
- Format the SD card
- Mount stuff in your linux distro (I use Arch BTW :D))
- Copy the stage 3 Gentoo to your mounted SD drive
- Copy the boot stuff Kernel and modules to boot
- Config correct keyboard
- Config correct local
- Config FSTAB
- remove pass from root user
- reboot
... Will continue
