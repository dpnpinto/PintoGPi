# PintoGPi
## This project is just a Gentoo intalation in Pi model 1 B+ with a [Zx Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) emulator
- Why Gentoo, just because I can and I whant to test some cross compiling "techniques" ;)
- The instalations will be made all from  may ARch Instalations [PintArch](https://github.com/dpnpinto/PintArch)
- Don't you my instlations, install [Arch](https://archlinux.org) from scratch and, then, you are prepared for [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org)

... Will continue
